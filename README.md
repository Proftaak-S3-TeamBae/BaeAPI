# BaeAPI

The backend API for the Bae AI Scanner solution.

## How to develop

To start developing, ensure you are located on the `develop` branch (or a feature branch).

When this is done, simply open `BaeAPI.sln` in Visual Studio to get started. After this, make sure you have an appropriate `appsettings.json` file for BaeServer.
